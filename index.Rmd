I am a PhD candidate at the University of Minnesota's School of Nursing, where I study human milk feeding and direct breastfeeding for infants with congenital heart disease (CHD). I hold previous DM and MM degrees in Piano Performance and Pedagogy from Northwestern University, but was inspired to change careers due to my own experience as a parent of a child unexpectedly diagnosed with CHD after birth.

I work as a graduate assistant and nurse interventionist for Dr. Anne Chevalier McKechnie at the University of Minnesota, and am the Co-Investigator on two funded grants to developing and testing eHealth enhanced care programs to support parents with a fetal diagnosis of CHD.  [Click here](https://nursing.umn.edu/research/research-projects/preparing-heart-and-mind) to learn more about our ongoing studies.  
\
\
My current projects include a funded qualitative study, investigating how lactating parents are able to establish a direct breastfeeding relationship with an infant hospitalized after birth for CHD. Please [click here](publications.html) to find a poster of the initial results from this study. My dissertation is a secondary analysis of data from the National Pediatric Quality Improvement Collaborative titled "Human milk and direct breastfeeding for infants with single ventricle congenital heart disease: An analysis of prevalence, supportive and limiting factors, and impact on key outcomes."
